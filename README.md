# How to use the BountyList Twitter Bot

Create a file called secrets.json and include the following information:
```
{
      "consumer_key": ""
      "consumer_secret": "",
      "access_token": "",
      "access_token_secret": "",
      "bearer_token": ""
}
```
Fill in the entries with your personal Twitter developer API key / access key / etc. If you don't have any of these, you can generate them by going to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard and creating a new project.
