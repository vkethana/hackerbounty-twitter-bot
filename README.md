# How the Bountylist Twitter Bot Works
The `bot.py` file is placed into a Google Cloud function. Whenever a user makes a request to the function's URL, the Cloud Function calls the `update_bot` method. `update_bot` scrapes the bountylist website and uses Tweepy to post the latest bounties to the Twitter account.
Note that this code assumes you have configured the environment variables `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, `access_token_secret`, and `bearer_token` appropriately in your Google Cloud function / AWS Lambda / whatever. (AWS Lambda is not recommended for Twitter bots because the installation process is a little trickier.)
